- [ ] I am sure this issue is not simply a general python programming problem
      (if so, please use google, chatGTP or Bing Chat to find the answers).
- [ ] I have searched github issues and confirm this issue has not reported previously.
- [ ] I have confirmed the problem or enhancement is about the latest docs of dynamo rather than dynamo itself (if so, please use Bug report template).

**If this is a question and not a bug report or enhancement request, please post to our Github Discussions channel at [https://github.com/aristoteleo/dynamo-release/discussions](https://github.com/aristoteleo/dynamo-release/discussions)**

## Problems on code of the docs
Please report the codes in the docs that generate unexpected output here. 

**Describe the problem**
A clear and concise description of what is wrong on the documentation or what should be improved.
Please make it clear in which chapter and which section the problem located (e.g. CONVENTIONAL SCRNA-SEQ => Zebrafish pigmentation => Load data). 

**To Reproduce**
If the docs have any code that not work properly, show it here: 

**Traceback**
If the code in the doc generate any error, post the error message from the Tracebook output: 

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**session_info.show():**
Install session-info via `pip install session-info` and post the output after running session_info.show()

```
import dynamo as dyn
import session_info
session_info.show()
```

Since we now included session_info in dynamo. we can also use the following command to show the session info directly:
```
dyn.session_info()
```

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

## Enhancement on text
Please tell us your ideas about the general description texts here. 

**Unclear or insufficient chapter**

**Expected information or improvement**
Please tell us what extra information you want to know in this section or how the expressions in this section could be improved.
